  How to USE the Coding Hermes Scheduler for real: REST API dialect (snake_case,
  envelopes), MCP tools (fleet_* only — fleet_add accepts repo or repo_url),
  dashboard, project lifecycle (create/PUT/DELETE soft+purge), board format,
  sim/verify harnesses, and the known traps (spawn tick_id unresolvable,
  fleet_ticks PascalCase, migrate silent skips, --simulate doesn't simulate).

# Scheduler Usage — Operating the Fleet Scheduler for Real

The scheduler is a single Go daemon (`bin/schedulerd`, SQLite/WAL) that
dispatches foreman ticks for 40+ projects. REST on `127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1`,
MCP JSON-RPC on `/mcp`, htmx dashboard at `/`. Live DB:
`~/.hermes/coding-hermes/scheduler.db` (daemon runs via systemd user unit
`coding-hermes-scheduler.service`, `-config /home/kara/.hermes/fleet.toml`,
`--auto-disable-failure-rate 0.9`).

v1.3.0 (2026-09-09 dogfood run): GAP-101 resume-wedge re-proven at HEAD
5d0ab6f; sim-setup boot-race flake documented; --simulate scratch-daemon
workflow verified; prod spawn counters (2415 exec / 66 http) contradict the
no-exec-fallback default — see docs/dogfood/2026-09-09-integration.md.

## Golden rules (verified 2026-08-25)

1. **The wire format is snake_case everywhere on REST** (S06 conformance):
   `cooldown_s`, `decay_rate`, `disabled_at`… Lists come in envelopes:
   `GET /api/v1/projects` → `{"projects":[…]}`; detail →
   `{"project":{…},"latest_tick":…}`. PascalCase keys are still ACCEPTED on
   decode (legacy), so old scripts keep working — but read with snake_case.
   Exception: **MCP `fleet_ticks` returns PascalCase** (`ID`, `ProjectName`,
   `Status`…) — DOGFOOD-016 open; don't trust the dialect there.
2. **Create a project with the minimal spec body** (works since DOGFOOD-001):
   `{"name":"X","repo_url":"…","workdir":"/abs/path"}` → 201, created
   DISABLED with defaults weight 10 / priority 5 / cooldown_s 900 /
   decay_rate 1.0. Dup name → 409. Same workdir as an enabled project → 409.
   Enable with `PUT {"enabled":true}`.
3. **DELETE is a SOFT delete with an optional purge.** `DELETE
   /api/v1/projects/{name}?confirm=true` → 200 but the row persists
   (enabled=0, `disabled_by="api-delete"`); 409 while enabled. Add
   `&purge=true` to hard-delete the row (DOGFOOD-009 fixed 08-25) — purge is
   what keeps scratch lifecycle tests from accumulating forever.
4. **PUT to change cooldown/decay/enabled**:
   `curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/projects/<NAME> -d '{"cooldown_s":900,"decay_rate":1.0}'`.
   This is how the stand-in cron wakes paused foremen (CooldownS/PascalCase
   also accepted).
5. **Do NOT trust `--simulate`** (still real-spawner; ticks fail with "no
   gateway client and exec fallback disabled" without gateway credentials —
   or spawn real foremen with them). `--sim-count N` is FIXED (DOGFOOD-007
   closed 08-25: generates N simulated ticks, exit 0). `--sim-setup
   --sim-ticks N` gives a 13-project fixture (12 enabled + 1 disabled).
6. **MCP tool names are the 14 `fleet_*` tools** (`fleet_status`,
   `fleet_projects`, `fleet_project_detail`, `fleet_set_weight`,
   `fleet_set_priority`, `fleet_set_cooldown`, `fleet_set_decay`,
   `fleet_pause`, `fleet_resume`, `fleet_add`, `fleet_ticks`,
   `fleet_evaluate`, `fleet_pause_scheduler`, `fleet_resume_scheduler`).
   The README's second MCP table (`list_projects`, `get_project`, …) is
   fiction (DOGFOOD-011) — `tools/call list_projects` → "unknown tool".
7. **The board is JSONL in `.coding-hermes/board/`** (tasks.jsonl git-tracked
   + DuckDB board.db mirror kept in parity). Append one JSON object per line
   (id, title, status, priority, complexity, capability_tags, created_at…),
   then mirror into board.db with delete-then-insert (the tasks table has NO
   primary key — `INSERT OR REPLACE` fails with a Binder error). Validate with
   `python3 -c "import json;[json.loads(l) for l in open('tasks.jsonl')]"`.
8. **MCP `fleet_add` works (DOGFOOD-014 fixed, tick #484):** accepts `repo`
   (canonical) or `repo_url` (alias, REST-style name, DOGFOOD-019) for the
   git URL. REST `POST /api/v1/projects` also works. Use either surface to
   create projects.
9. **Do NOT poll `GET /ticks/{id}` with the tick_id returned by
   `POST /projects/{name}/spawn`** (DOGFOOD-015, P1, open): the spawn
   response formats the id in UTC, the stored row in local time → 404
   ("tick not found") on a -05:00 host. Instead list
   `GET /ticks?project=<name>` and use the id from the list.
10. **`bin/migrate` only imports "coding-hermes"-flavored jobs** (name/skills
    must mention coding-hermes or foreman AND the prompt must contain a
    workdir path); everything else is skipped SILENTLY — "0 imported, 2
    skipped" with no per-job reason (DOGFOOD-017). Name jobs
    `<proj> coding-hermes-foreman` and include `Workdir: /abs/path`.

## Endpoint cheat sheet (verified 2026-08-15)

| Route | Use |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/health` | liveness + DB + active ticks + `evaluation_age_seconds` |
| `GET /api/v1/status` | fleet summary; `active_projects`, `auto_disable{enabled,threshold,window,min_ticks}`, `projects_failure_rates` (per-project over `failure_window`=100), `recent_outcomes` (LIFETIME counts — name is misleading), `zero_select_consecutive/eligible/last_at` (GAP-043 diagnostics) |
| `GET /api/v1/projects` | list, `{"projects":[…]}` snake_case |
| `GET /api/v1/projects/{name}` | `{"project":…,"latest_tick":…}`; 404 `{"error":"project not found"}` |
| `POST /api/v1/projects` | create (minimal snake_case body; defaults; created disabled; dup-name 409) |
| `PUT /api/v1/projects/{name}` | partial update (snake_case or PascalCase) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{name}?confirm=true` | soft delete (409 if enabled); add `&purge=true` to hard-delete |
| `GET /api/v1/ticks?project=X&limit=N` | newest-first, `{count,ticks}`; rows carry tokens/cost_usd/commits/exit_code |
| `GET /api/v1/events?severity=HIGH&limit=N` | event feed; `loop` HIGH events = eval-stall watchdog firing (GAP-042 — by design) |
| `GET /api/v1/namespaces` | namespace weights |
| `POST /api/v1/evaluate` | force evaluation (safe, signal-only; resets evaluation_age) |
| `POST /api/v1/pause` / `resume` | fleet-wide, process-local, idempotent |
| `POST /mcp` | JSON-RPC 2.0: initialize → tools/list → tools/call (fleet_* only) |

## MCP call format

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":N,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"fleet_status","arguments":{}}}`.
Read-only tools (`fleet_status`, `fleet_projects`, `fleet_project_detail`,
`fleet_ticks`) are safe anytime. **`fleet_add` works** (DOGFOOD-014 fixed):
pass `repo` or its REST-style alias `repo_url` for the git URL (DOGFOOD-019);
REST `POST /api/v1/projects` also works. `fleet_ticks` output is PascalCase
(DOGFOOD-016).

## Diagnostics and verification

- `deploy/scheduler-verify.sh` (crontab 2h) → `./bin/schedulerd --test-verify 3`.
  **GREEN since 08-04 fix** (logs in `deploy/verify-*.log`; today's 06/08/10
  UTC runs: "6 checks, 0 failures, ✅ SCHEDULER VERIFIED"). It also prints a
  perf audit (p99 /status ≈16ms at 29k rows — spec S10 <100ms PASS) and a
  per-project failure breakdown.
- `--test-verify 3` on any scratch DB is the fastest way to validate the
  whole engine end-to-end without touching the live fleet.
- `--sim-setup --sim-ticks N` gives a 13-project fixture (12 enabled + 1
  disabled) + simulated ticks + report.
- `--schema` prints a JSON Schema for a root `schedulerd.toml` that the
  daemon does NOT load yet (FEAT-005 wiring); `--show-config` prints the
  EFFECTIVE configuration (CLI flags + SCHEDULER_* env overrides applied)
  and comments which env vars are active. Env vars DO work at boot
  (e.g. `SCHEDULER_AUTO_DISABLE_FAILURE_RATE`). Root TOML values are not
  loaded until FEAT-005 (DOGFOOD-012).
- Live signals: `zero_select_consecutive=0` + regular `EVAL:` lines in
  `~/.hermes/coding-hermes/scheduler.log` = loop healthy. `EVAL-STALL:`
  lines = watchdog forced re-eval after 5 idle minutes (by design, GAP-042).

## Pitfalls

- **RESUME IS NOT IDEMPOTENT (GAP-101, re-proven 2026-09-09):** a redundant
  `POST /api/v1/resume` on an UNPAUSED loop wedges evaluation — log shows
  `LOOP: paused`, ticks stop, `paused` stays null in status. Never blind-fire
  resume in deploy/automation scripts; only resume after a confirmed pause.
- **`--sim-setup` flakes ~1/7 on a fresh DB** (boot race, FK constraint at
  fixture wipe, main.go:328) — if it FATALs, rerun on a clean db path; it's
  not corruption (DOGFOOD-021).
- **Scratch-test safely:** `--simulate` on a FREE port (9091 is squatted by
  an unrelated service — `ss -tlnp` first) + scratch DB + `cooldown_s:1`
  projects → real tick lifecycle in seconds without touching prod.
- `go test -short -p 1 ./...` = 38s; `--test-verify 3` = the L3 harness
  ("✅ SCHEDULER VERIFIED", 6 checks).
- `.coding-hermes/tasks.md` is dead (`.bak`); the board is
  `.coding-hermes/board/tasks.jsonl`. The outer dir pointer file
  (`/home/kara/coding-hermes-scheduler/.coding-hermes/tasks.md`) is
  intentionally not a board.
- `/fleet …` chat slash commands: the plugin symlink is FIXED (re-pointed
  08-15, DOGFOOD-008) and `add` works (DOGFOOD-014 fixed, DOGFOOD-019 alias);
  the read-only commands (`status`, `projects`, `ticks`, …) work.
- `docs/fleet.md` is regenerated from the live API (docs/regenerate_fleet.py;
  last run 2026-08-25, 74 projects/42 enabled) — but trust the API over any
  mirror. Repo `fleet.toml` is a partial mirror (DOGFOOD-013).
- `AGENTS.md` claims `/api/v1/events` supports SSE — it returns plain JSON
  for stream=1/stream=true/Accept: text/event-stream (DOGFOOD-016).
- Eval-stall events ("eval loop stalled — forced re-evaluation (recovered)",
  MEDIUM) fire ~hourly while the fleet idles — GAP-042 watchdog by design,
  but noisy (DOGFOOD-018); don't read them as outages.
- No auth on anything — loopback only, treat as operator-only.
- The daemon binary at `bin/schedulerd` is what's running; systemd user unit
  `coding-hermes-scheduler.service` builds it via ExecStartPre. Rebuild +
  `systemctl --user restart coding-hermes-scheduler` after code changes.
- Disable-provenance: new disables stamp `disabled_at/by/reason`; 25 legacy
  disabled rows are empty (DOGFOOD-010) — don't read their absence as a bug
  in your own changes.
